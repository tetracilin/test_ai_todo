/**
 * Drift guard for the Docker build-stamp wiring.
 *
 * The server build runs scripts/write-build-stamp.mjs, which stamps the built
 * commit into dist/build-info.json. The build context has no .git, so the
 * script reads PAPERCLIP_BUILD_COMMIT instead. Docker exposes an ARG to the
 * next RUN as an environment variable, but an ARG goes out of scope at the end
 * of its stage. So the build stage must declare `ARG PAPERCLIP_BUILD_COMMIT`
 * before the server build; the production ARG alone stamps nothing, because
 * the server build already ran in the earlier stage.
 *
 * This guard fails if a refactor drops the build-stage ARG, moves it after the
 * server build, or removes the build-args the deploy workflows pass.
